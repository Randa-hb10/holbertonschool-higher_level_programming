**0. Basic Serialization**

* JSON serialization and deserialization for dictionaries.

**1. Pickling Custom Classes**

* Object saving and loading using pickle.

**2. CSV to JSON Conversion**

* Data transformation using csv.DictReader and json.

**3. XML Serialization & Deserialization**

* Data handling with xml.etree.ElementTree.
