# Python - Exceptions

## Description

This project covers the concept of **exceptions in Python**. It focuses on handling errors safely using `try`, `except`, and `finally`, as well as raising built-in exceptions when required.

The goal is to write robust programs that do not crash when encountering unexpected situations.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, I am able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* What are exceptions
* What is the difference between errors and exceptions
* What are exceptions and how to use them
* When to use exceptions
* How to correctly handle an exception
* How to raise a built-in exception
* When to implement a clean-up action after an exception

## Requirements

* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All files end with a new line
* The first line of all files is exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Code should use the `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*)
* All files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
