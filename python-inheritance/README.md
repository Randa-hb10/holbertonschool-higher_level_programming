Python Inheritance

This project focuses on practicing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, with an emphasis on inheritance, subclasses, method overriding, and type checking.

Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will understand:

Superclasses and subclasses

How inheritance works in Python

How to list attributes and methods of objects

Method and attribute overriding

Using isinstance, issubclass, type, and super()

When and how instances can have new attributes

Requirements

Python 3.8.5+

PEP8 compliant code

Executable Python scripts (#!/usr/bin/python3)

Proper documentation (docstrings) for all modules, classes, and functions

Project Files

0-lookup.py: Lists available attributes and methods of an object

1-my_list.py: Custom list class with a print_sorted() method

2-is_same_class.py: Checks if an object is exactly an instance of a class

3-is_kind_of_class.py: Checks if an object is an instance or subclass of a class

4-inherits_from.py: Checks if an object inherits from a class

5–7-base_geometry.py: BaseGeometry class with validation methods

8–9-rectangle.py: Rectangle class with area and string representation

10–11-square.py: Square class inheriting from Rectangle
